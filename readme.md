# Bergen Community Science Museum
For this project I was tasked with creating a website for a fictional local museum. 

It contains:

- main page
- exhibitions page
- special events page
- about us page
- get involved page

## Description

This project involved creating a website for a fictional science museum. It required a main page, exhibitions page, special events page, about us page and a page about how to get involved with the museum. I was provided with image assets as well as some text I could use but could also come up with my own.

This project is an exercise in design and design implementations, creating a website that's responsive and follows wcag guidelines as well as being as bug free as possible.

The design was based on an initial prototype created in figma. It was important to create a design that was simple but informative while also getting the audience excited about going to the museum. It was meant to appeal to parents and their children.
